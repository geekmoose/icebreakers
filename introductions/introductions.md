#Introductions Icebreaker

##About
This is an easy icebreaker to do and doesn't require any equipment. It can be done with any size group, but thought needs to be given to the amount of time needed to feedback, as each person will speak. 

##How to run
Ask people to pair up, and 'interview' the person next to them. You can either allow the pairs to decide what to ask about, or you can give some specific direction 'find out what their job role is, their favourite colour, and an interesting fact' 

Give an appropriate period of time, and remember to prompt the pairs to swap over - this will help to ensure that both people get equal time. If you have an odd number and end up with a group of three then prompt this group to swap over at a suitable point in time.
